This project starts with library code borrowed from [@kiyoshigawa](https://github.com/kiyoshigawa)'s [esp8266_led_display](https://github.com/kiyoshigawa/esp8266_led_display) project, which is a C++/Platform.io implementation of a little network synced clock running on an ESP8266 with our red LED matrix.
